> **What this fork adds:**
> - arm64 Linux build target (FEX x86→arm64 CPU backend + SDL3 desktop frontend)
> - A/B–X/Y glyph swap toggle — relabels on-screen button hints without changing button actions
> - Controller button icons shown immediately when a controller is detected

**xbased** runs original Xbox games on a PC with a reimplemented Xbox kernel,
a high-level NV2A renderer on Vulkan and an accurate MCPX audio core, behind a
console-style front end of its own.
No BIOS, MCPX ROM or hard-disk image is needed.

## Download

| Platform | File | |
|---|---|---|
| **Windows** 10/11 (x64) | `xbased-1.0.89-windows-x64.zip` | Unzip anywhere and run `xbased.exe`. Portable: everything stays in its folder. |
| **Linux** (x86-64) | `xbased-1.0.89-x86_64.AppImage` | `chmod +x` it and run. Ubuntu 22.04 or newer, or any distribution of the same age. |

Get them from **[Releases](https://github.com/crazyriddler/xbased/releases/latest)**.

**Requirements:** a GPU with Vulkan 1.1 or newer (1.3 recommended), a CPU with
SSE4.1, and your own game images (ISO / XISO) dumped from discs you own.
xbased doesn't include any copyrighted Xbox software.

## Features

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### Like a console
- **Console-style dashboard**: an animated green orb, drifting hexagons, 3D
  transitions and navigation sounds.
- **Gamepad, keyboard or mouse** everywhere; button prompts follow the device
  you're using.
- **Borderless full screen by default**, any resolution, ultrawide or portrait,
  any DPI. On a 144 or 165 Hz monitor without G-Sync or FreeSync, full screen
  can switch to the monitor's highest mode that's a multiple of 60 Hz
  (Settings › Video › Full screen refresh), so every frame shows for the same
  time.
- **Overscan and crop**: hide a game's borders all round, or its sides and its
  top and bottom apart, globally or per game; what's cut stays cut, also
  beside a 4:3 picture.
- **Exit from the gamepad**, with a confirmation.
- **Automatic updates**: a new release is offered as xbased starts and
  installs itself (Settings › Interface turns the check off and on).

</td>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### Your library
- **Automatic box art** and the discs' own title icons.
- **Big libraries**: hundreds of games across many folders and drives load
  in the background (a counter shows how many so far) and are playable as
  they come; the list is back at once the next time.
- **Search and filters**: by name, publisher, year and region, typed on the
  keyboard or on an on-screen keyboard with the gamepad. Order by name
  (numbers first, then A to Z), publisher or year, and jump between letters
  with the triggers (Z and C on the keyboard).
- **Three views**: large covers, small covers or icons with names (the View
  button or V).
- **Favorites and the last played first**, each one can be turned off.
- **A page per game**: play, load a state, settings, patches, controls; rename
  it, pick your own cover image, hide it, or make a **desktop shortcut** that
  starts it straight away (handy for Steam and other front ends).
- **Disc images**: ISO, XISO and **CHD** (`chdman createdvd` or `createcd`).
- **Memory manager**: your games' saves with their icons; export, import and
  delete.
- **Import from xemu**: xemu's saves copied in and re-signed so games accept
  them (Memory, Y).
- **Broad compatibility** with many games, inherited from hakuX.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

### Picture
- **Internal resolution** up to 8x, aspect ratio, widescreen and video modes.
- **FXAA** and **anisotropic filtering** up to 16x.
- **Upscaling**: bilinear or AMD FSR 1.
- **CRT filters**: soft scanlines, a classic TV, an arcade monitor.
- Every setting **global or per game**.

</td>
<td valign="top">

### Patches & mods
- **Per-game patches**: 60/120 fps, widescreen, fixes and cheats, toggled per
  game. Over 160 widescreen, 60 fps and 480p patches ship with it, plus a
  widescreen database for 90 games that finds its patterns in your disc's
  executable.
- **Cheats for 500 games**: the Xbox scene's cheat files (.etm, .xbtf)
  come with xbased and their options show up in each game's Mods & patches.
  Add your own to `cheats/<TITLE ID>/`.
- **Frame rate per game**: Original, up to 60, up to 120 or unlocked, where
  the game allows it (anything but Original can break a game). An unlocked
  game is held to your monitor's refresh rate by default, never under 60
  (Settings › Video › Uncapped games' limit), as some games have no frame
  cap of their own.
- **Downloaded content and title updates** copied into
  `hdd/Partition1/TDATA/<title id>/` are signed for xbased as the game starts.
- **Add your own**: drop the IPS patches shared online into
  `mods/<TITLE ID>/` and they show up in the game's menu
  ([MODS.md](mods/README.md)).

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

### Save states & in-game menu
- **10 save-state slots per game**, with pictures.
- **In-game menu** with F1, or **Back + Start** / the **Guide** button on a
  gamepad: states, settings, controls, restart, back to the dashboard.
- **Shortcuts**: F5 quick save, F8 quick load, Tab fast forward, F2 pause,
  F12 screenshot, F11 full screen; all configurable, with Ctrl, Alt or Shift
  too, and on the controller as Guide plus a button, the touchpad or Share.

</td>
<td valign="top">

### Controls, online, languages
- **4 controller ports**: Automatic, any gamepad or the keyboard; remap every
  button, per game too; dead zone and vibration.
- **Sticks like the Xbox controller's**: a modern stick's circle reaches the
  Duke's full square, so diagonals register. Stick range and shape are set
  on a screen that shows both sticks live, the range games expect and the
  range yours reaches. Triggers get their own calibration screen too (dead
  zone and full press).
- **PAL games at 60 Hz**, as with the console's PAL-60 setting on; 50 Hz is
  an option, for all games or one.
- **Stereo or 5.1 surround**: the games' Dolby Digital mix, six channels
  out (Settings › Audio; stereo by default).
- **Online**: Insignia (the community's Xbox Live replacement), XLink Kai and
  System Link on your network.
- **11 languages**, your system's by default. Games start in your language,
  or in English when the disc doesn't have it.

## Getting started

1. Download xbased from [Releases](https://github.com/crazyriddler/xbased/releases/latest):
   unzip it anywhere (Windows) or run the AppImage (Linux).
2. Start it: the dashboard opens. In **Games**, choose **Add games** (the last
   card, or A on an empty library) to open the file browser: go to the folder
   with your disc images and press X to add it, or A on a single image to add
   just that one. It works with a gamepad, the keyboard or the mouse, and
   lists every drive or mounted disk with its free space.
3. Choose a game in **Games**. Box art downloads automatically (it can be
   turned off).

Command line: `xbased <image.iso or .chd> [options]` starts a game directly; options
are the same as the settings files' lines (`scale=2`, `uncap`, `crt=2`,
`fullscreen=0`, `mod=<patch>`...). Settings are kept in `xbased.ini` (global)
and `games/<TITLE ID>.<version>.ini` (per game) beside the executable on
Windows, in `~/.local/share/xbased/` on Linux.

### Default keyboard controls

| Xbox | Key | Xbox | Key |
|---|---|---|---|
| A / B / X / Y | Space / Left Shift / Q / E | Left stick | W A S D |
| Black / White | C / Z | Right stick | I J K L |
| Left / right trigger | 1 / 3 | D-pad | Arrow keys |
| Start / Back | Enter / Backspace | Stick clicks | F / H |

**Shortcuts:** F1 menu, F5 quick save, F8 quick load (Shift: slot 2), Tab fast
forward (hold), F2 pause, F12 screenshot, F11 full screen. On a gamepad,
Back + Start or a tap of the Guide button opens the menu and Share takes a
screenshot. In Settings › Shortcuts any of them can be a key with Ctrl, Alt
or Shift, and on the controller Guide plus a button (held: the game doesn't
see that button), the touchpad or Share. Those are buttons the Xbox
controller doesn't have, so no game uses them.

### Playing on Insignia

[Insignia](https://insignia.live) is the community's free Xbox Live
replacement. To play on it:

1. In **Online**, set **Network** to **Insignia** (its DNS is filled in).
2. Get Insignia's Setup Assistant disc image from
   [insignia.live](https://insignia.live/guide/connect), add it to your games
   like any other image and start it. It registers this console: follow its
   steps and enter the code it shows on the website.
3. For your Xbox Live account you need the Xbox dashboard (version 5960):
   put its files (`xboxdash.xbe` and its folders) in `hdd/Partition2`, the
   hard disk's C: drive, beside the executable. Then open it from **Online**
   with **Xbox dashboard**, and in Xbox Live create a new account or recover
   the one you have.
4. Start a game that supports Xbox Live and sign in from its own Xbox Live
   menu.

The Insignia disc image doesn't go in `hdd/Partition2`: it's started as a
game. Only the Xbox dashboard's files go there.

## Building from source

xbased builds with clang and CMake. The third-party sources are fetched at
pinned versions by `tools/fetch_deps.sh` into a `deps` folder beside the
repository:

```
<work>/
  xbased/      this repository
  deps/        third-party sources (tools/fetch_deps.sh)
  build/       build trees
```

The executable is built from the `hakux` target and named `xbased`.

### Windows (x64)

1. Install [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) and open the **MSYS2 CLANG64** shell.
2. Install the toolchain:

   ```bash
   pacman -S --needed git mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-clang mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-lld \
     mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-cmake mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-ninja mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-python
   ```

3. Get the source, fetch the dependencies and build:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/crazyriddler/xbased
   cd xbased
   tools/fetch_deps.sh
   cmake -S native -B ../build/win -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
     -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++
   cmake --build ../build/win --target hakux
   ```

`../build/win/xbased.exe` runs from the build folder (its fonts and mods are
copied beside it). It imports only system DLLs, so it runs on any Windows
10/11 x64 with a Vulkan driver. To make the release zip in `../dist`
(PowerShell): `tools\release\package_windows.ps1`

### Linux (x86-64)

1. Install the packages (Ubuntu/Debian; on other distributions, the same
   libraries' development packages):

   ```bash
   sudo apt install git clang lld cmake ninja-build pkg-config python3 zlib1g-dev \
     libx11-dev libxext-dev libxrandr-dev libxcursor-dev libxi-dev libxss-dev libxtst-dev libxfixes-dev \
     libxkbcommon-dev libwayland-dev wayland-protocols libegl-dev libgl-dev libdecor-0-dev \
     libdrm-dev libgbm-dev libasound2-dev libpulse-dev libpipewire-0.3-dev libudev-dev \
     libdbus-1-dev libibus-1.0-dev
   ```

2. Get the source, fetch the dependencies and build:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/crazyriddler/xbased
   cd xbased
   tools/fetch_deps.sh
   cmake -S native -B ../build/linux -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
     -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++
   cmake --build ../build/linux --target hakux
   ```

`../build/linux/xbased` runs from the build folder. Settings, saves and states
go to `~/.local/share/xbased` (or beside the executable when a `portable.txt`
is there). SDL3 is linked statically; at run time the system needs glibc 2.35
or newer and a Vulkan driver (Mesa or the GPU vendor's). To make the AppImage
in `../dist`: `tools/release/package_linux.sh ../build/linux` (the release
one is built on Ubuntu 22.04, so it runs there and on newer distributions).

More options (link-time optimization, the dependencies' location) are in
[BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md).

## Thanks

xbased's cheat and patch database is the work of the Xbox community, and
it's here thanks to them:

- **The cheat makers of the Xbox scene**: xboxtrainers.net, Team Evox-T,
  Team Xored, Angelfly, k_away, Hitman, RoBoZeO, Falcon3, Thatguy, Xor and
  everyone else who made the .etm and .xbtf cheat files EvolutionX,
  Avalaunch and XBMC4Xbox ran (known there as trainers). The files come from
  the [Xbox Original ETM Trainers](https://archive.org/details/ETMTrainers)
  collection on the Internet Archive.
- **[XBMC4Xbox](https://github.com/Rocky5/XBMC4Xbox)** and Team Xored, whose
  trainer loader showed how those files run (xbased loads the same helper
  routines for .xbtf files).
- **[icup321](https://github.com/icup321/XboxGraphicalPatches)** and
  **[Slippy2k](https://github.com/Slippy2k/XboxGraphicalPatches)** for their
  widescreen, 60 fps and 480p patches, and the **OgXHD** widescreen
  database that comes with them.
- **[xemu](https://xemu.app)** and its [xdb](https://github.com/xemu-project/xdb)
  title database, which matched every patch to its game.
- **[raddad772](https://github.com/raddad772)**, whose measurements of the
  audio chip on a retail console (xemu pull request
  [#3105](https://github.com/xemu-project/xemu/pull/3105)) the sound
  emulation follows: the HRTF taps and routing, the filters, the resampler,
  the volume curve, envelopes, LFOs and ramps.
- **[P1Login](https://github.com/P1Login)**, for testing on AMD hardware,
  logs, workarounds for other users and the help across many issues.
- Everyone who reports issues, tests games and shares saves and logs: that's
  how the games on the list got fixed.
